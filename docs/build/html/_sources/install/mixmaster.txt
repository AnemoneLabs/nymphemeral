=========
Follow the `mixmaster instructions`_ to get `mixmaster`_ running.
**Make sure you have** `OpenSSL`_ **1.0.1g or later.** If your
*mixmaster* configuration is located anywhere other than the default
``~/Mix`` directory, you should edit
``~/.config/nymphemeral/nymphemeral.cfg`` to point to your
configuration.

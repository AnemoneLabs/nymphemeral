Mixmaster
=========
This section describes how to compile the new large-key version of
*Mixmaster* on a *Debian Wheezy* system. If you already have
**Mixmaster 3** installed and configured you can go to
:ref:`installed_mixmaster`. If you are a `Whonix`_ user, you should
go to :ref:`mixmaster-whonix`.

Most of the content of this section was taken from `this post`_ by
the `Jeremy Bentham Remailer`_ Admin. The instructions should be
helpful for building *Mixmaster* on other flavors of linux as well.
See :ref:`ubuntu-loader` for a change if using *Ubuntu*.

Preliminaries
-------------
First, you need to install the packages required by *Mixmaster* and
*OpenSSL*::

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libpcre3-dev wget \
    zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev curl perl bc dc bison libbison-dev

Build OpenSSL
-------------
Then you need to compile a version of *OpenSSL* that contains the
*IDEA* cipher. Grab the most recent version (make sure it is version
1.0.1g or later!) from the `OpenSSL download page`_.

Extract the tarball (substituting your version for 1.0.1g)::

    tar xvf openssl-1.0.1g.tar.gz

Build the distribution::

    cd openssl-1.0.1g
    ./config
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

Note that this installs *OpenSSL* into ``/usr/local/ssl``. Symlink
the new *OpenSSL* installation into your normal lib and include
directories so that the *Mixmaster* install script can find them.
Note that the ``sudo mv`` instructions below will only work if you
have previous copies of the files installed. If you get an error
along the lines of ``mv: cannot stat libssl.a`` or similar, just
ignore it - you did not have a file there to move::

    cd /usr/lib
    sudo mv libssl.a libssl.a.old
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/ssl/lib/libssl.a libssl.a
    sudo mv libcrypto.a libcrypto.a.old
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/ssl/lib/libcrypto.a libcrypto.a
    cd /usr/include
    sudo mv openssl openssl.old
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/ssl/include/openssl openssl


Build Mixmaster
---------------

Download `Mixmaster 3.0.3`_.

Be sure to verify the SHA256 hash of the downloaded file. You can do
this by executing the command::

    sha256sum mixmaster-3.0.3b.tar.gz

The output should match the following hex number::

    4cd6121e49cddba9b0771d453fa7b6cf824bee920af36206d1414388a47708de

Extract the *Mixmaster* tarball::

    tar xvf mixmaster-3.0.3b.tar.gz

Run the ``Install`` script::

    cd mixmaster-3.0.3b
    ./Install

Answer the questions posed by the script:

- You can just press enter when it prompts for the installation
  directory. It will be installed at ``~/Mix``

- Do not worry about the *OpenSSL* version questions - 1.0.1g+ is so
  new the script does not know about it - select the default **YES**

- Your new version of *OpenSSL* **does** have AES encryption, so
  answer **YES** to that question as well

- As we are going to only use *Mixmaster* as a client (with
  nymphemeral), answer **NO** to the question about running a
  remailer

*Mixmaster* should be installed successfully.

.. _ubuntu-loader:

Ubuntu Loader Changes
'''''''''''''''''''''
If you are using *Ubuntu* and see the following compile error::

    gcc mix.o rem.o rem1.o rem2.o chain.o chain1.o chain2.o nym.o pgp.o pgpdb.o pgpdata.o pgpget.o pgpcreat.o pool.o mail.o rfc822.o mime.o keymgt.o compress.o stats.o crypto.o random.o util.o buffers.o maildir.o parsedate.tab.o rndseed.o menu.o menusend.o menunym.o menuutil.o menustats.o main.o /usr/local/ssl/lib/libcrypto.a  -lz -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ -lpcre -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/  -lncurses -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ -o mixmaster

    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line
    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
    make: *** [mixmaster] Error 1
    Error: The compilation failed. Please consult the documentation (section `Installation problems').

you should make the following changes to the ``Install`` script, due
to modifications *Ubuntu* has made to the loader.

On line ``402`` of the ``Install`` script, change::

    LDFLAGS=

to::

    LDFLAGS="-ldl"

Getting New Remailer Stats
--------------------------
Before you can use *Mixmaster*, you need to update the stats. We are
going to use the pinger from the `Jeremy Bentham Remailer`_, but the
process should be similar to other pingers you wish to use.

An easy way to do this **securely** is with *curl*. First, create a
file called ``update.sh`` in your ``~/Mix`` directory, with the
following contents::

    #!/bin/bash
    export SSL_CERT_DIR=$HOME/Mix/certs
    rm pubring.asc pubring.mix mlist.txt rlist.txt
    curl --cacert ./certs/anemone.pem https://anemone.mooo.com/stats/mlist.txt -o mlist.txt
    curl --cacert ./certs/anemone.pem https://anemone.mooo.com/stats/rlist.txt -o rlist.txt
    curl --cacert ./certs/anemone.pem https://anemone.mooo.com/stats/pubring.mix -o pubring.mix
    curl --cacert ./certs/anemone.pem https://anemone.mooo.com/stats/pgp-all.asc -o pubring.asc

Change the script to executable mode::

    chmod +x update.sh

Next, create the ``~/Mix/certs`` directory and add
*anemone.mooo.com's* certificate::

    mkdir ~/Mix/certs
    cd ~/Mix/certs
    wget http://anemone.mooo.com/anemone.pem

Now that you have downloaded the certificate file, you can securely
update your remailer stats by simply::

    cd ~/Mix
    ./update.sh

You should update the remailer stats *at least once a day* when using
*Mixmaster*.

Config File
-----------
*Mixmaster* just needs to be configured through the ``~/Mix/mix.cfg``
file. A very simple config file could be written as follows::

    CHAIN *,*,*,*,*
    SMTPRELAY localhost
    SMTPPORT 2525
    HELONAME anonymous.invalid
    REMAILERADDR anonymous@anonymous.invalid

Chain
'''''
The ``CHAIN`` is the path that your messages will take before being
delivered. In the configuration above, the messages are going to pass
by five mixes, and finally get to the actual target. You can use any
sequence and number of mixes in the chain, passing their names or
simply ``*`` (which means that it could be any mix), separated by
commas.

**Note:** Adding more mixes to the chain will probably increase the
latency to deliver your messages. That is actually not a bad thing,
but you should decide how long you are willing to wait to exchange
messages.

SMTP Server
'''''''''''
If you followed :ref:`connections`, you remember that we will use
port ``2525`` to reach an SMTP server. Using the options
``SMTPRELAY`` and ``SMTPPORT`` will tell *Mixmaster* to use that
specific connection. Finally, as part of the protocol you need to
provide a ``HELONAME`` and a ``REMAILERADDR``. As we want to be
anonymous, we provide an invalid address.

.. note::

    nymphemeral should be ready to tunnel via Tor messages sent using
    Mixmaster!

.. _installed_mixmaster:

Pre-installed Mixmaster
-----------------------
Although we encorage the use of the *Mixmaster* version installed
with this section, improved with **4096-bit RSA** (and other
features), you are allowed to use any derivative of **Mixmaster 3**.
As long as you use that version and nymphemeral is able to find both
paths to the binary and config file, you are fine. Configuring these
paths is explained later on :ref:`cfg_mix`.

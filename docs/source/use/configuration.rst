   Configure Nym Tab

On the ``Configure Nym`` tab you can modify the ``Ephemeral Key``,
``hSub key`` and ``Name`` of your nym. Clicking on ``Configure`` will
create the message that will be sent to the server. If you wish to
not use your nym anymore, click ``Delete Nym``.

**Tip:** If you believe that the server is not processing your
messages, try to change the ``Ephemeral Key`` so that the databases
will be synced.
